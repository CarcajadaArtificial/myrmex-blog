I remember asking myself "Wait, what is a program? How can someone program a program? What is a programming language? How is a programming language created?" I would probably ask these same questions to my father, and he probably answered as best as he could. Still, nothing 

This wasn't my first encounter with "programming". Prior to this, my dad taught me how to make the terminal output a message after receiving a certain prompt, but that didn't catch my imagination as much as the markup pseudo-programming-language code found in the customization of MySpace profile pages. Here I interacted with the medium of programming for the first time. Changing certain recognizable keywords like "background", "font-size", or "position" was all it was at this time. Still, there was no programming in the true sense.
