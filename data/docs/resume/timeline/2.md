This wasn't my first encounter with "programming". Prior to this, my dad taught me how to make the terminal output a message after receiving a certain prompt, but that didn't catch my imagination as much as the markup pseudo-programming-language code found in the customization of MySpace profile pages. Here I interacted with the medium of programming for the first time. Changing certain recognizable keywords like "background", "font-size", or "position" was all it was at this time. Still, there was no programming in the true sense.
