It was the first half of my third year in high school. We've had boring computer courses in the likes of Microsoft Office, until now. The class had a new teacher and he taught us the basics of programming using vanilla Java. Loops, conditionals, variables, operations, and functions were the whole course. But it all felt like a huge cliffhanger, I still had a lot of doubts. I struggled even to articulate what I wanted to learn, I just needed a deeper understanding of computers, I guess.

The teacher from the Java class invited me to hear a college class on SQL, I remember vividly using it to store Pokemon information, I was replaying FireRed in my old GBA due to nostalgia. But that wasn't it. The next semester I joined the robotics club but I quickly saw that programming little kart brains was a very niche type of programming and shifted towards mechanics and electronics that were other interests I had.
