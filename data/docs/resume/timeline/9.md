This was the second project developed by our company GoIndigo. We started implementing the Design Sprint methodology that I learned in Icalia Labs. It worked great because we narrowed down the problem of the bottlenecks in the entering queues. The conferences in our school had certain conventions in logistics, so most of the application was tailor-made to suite those conventions.
