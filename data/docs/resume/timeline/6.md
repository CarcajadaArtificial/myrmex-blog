I got together with Daniel Gonzalez and we founded the company GoIndigo and we sold SaaS. In hindsight, I'm impressed we managed to sell a couple of projects with literally zero experience. But I know what I knew, and that was enough to make small projects with reasonable scopes. These were our first reality checks and all-nighters finishing a feature or fixing a bug. I really value this experience and am thankful for it to this day.

A startup called OTS Services hired us to develop a website where truck drivers and administrators could register and update information. The web application had different user roles and many tables for storing information. The site had the capability of generating PDF reports every so often.

This was the second project developed by our company GoIndigo. We started implementing the Design Sprint methodology that I learned in Icalia Labs. It worked great because we narrowed down the problem of the bottlenecks in the entering queues. The conferences in our school had certain conventions in logistics, so most of the application was tailor-made to suite those conventions.
