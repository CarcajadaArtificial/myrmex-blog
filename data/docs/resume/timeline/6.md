I got together with Daniel Gonzalez and we founded the company GoIndigo and we sold SaaS. In hindsight, I'm impressed we managed to sell a couple of projects with literally zero experience. But I know what I knew, and that was enough to make small projects with reasonable scopes. These were our first reality checks and all-nighters finishing a feature or fixing a bug. I really value this experience and am thankful for it to this day.

A startup called OTS Services hired us to develop a website where truck drivers and administrators could register and update information. The web application had different user roles and many tables for storing information. The site had the capability of generating PDF reports every so often.
