It was my first introduction to the design workplace. During my internship, I learned about UX/UI principles. Some essential topics were prerequisites (e.g., color theory, gestalt, and beginner use of design software). They focused on training more specific UI designs with Design Systems, UX with Gooleâ€™s Design Sprint, and introducing interns to front-end development using Sass.
