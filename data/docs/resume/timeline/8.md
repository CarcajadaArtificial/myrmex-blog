The project was developed by a startup called LIPS. We designed a product that allows users to voluntarily and anonymously upload their purchase history. Brands instead of segmenting their market share by traditional methods like age, gender, nationality, or interests, would see a list of anonymous users ranked by their likelihood to buy their specific good or service. Everything is totally customer-centric, making brands fight for the customer's attention by paying them directly instead of a Social Network intermediary. The idea was really cool, the team was really into the project but the company went bankrupt 2 months before the first release because of poor financial management.
