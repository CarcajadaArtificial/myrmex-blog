I was born in Mexico. As far as I can remember, I've always had an interest in video games and computers. But I also became very fond of drawing, animation, and movies. I can see the way how I approached things as a toddler is directly linked to the essential way that I think now. I firmly believe that this connection must be treasured and conserved as best as possible.
