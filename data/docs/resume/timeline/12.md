This project was one of the most difficult I've had to participate in. I had a minor interest in accessibility before, but during this project, it was almost an obsession. For starters, we had to come to peace with the idea that Sharepoint fails in accessibility and overrides for the native behavior were out of scope. The things that were under our control were still ruled by arbitrary rules and we had to constantly work around them or against them for a proper accessible experience.

Stack on top of that that the designer in charge of the prototype that will be used to test the interface didn't consider lots of states it can be in. The result was a site really difficult to build, and test, that must pass WCAG Level 2 AA. But in the end, we made it and even got recognized by our clients (Harvard) due to the proper delivery of a dire project.
