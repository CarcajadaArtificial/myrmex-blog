I actually started 2012 on a career in mechatronics engineering, but it was too industrial for me. Working in building or designing machines for factories definitely wasn't my thing, so I tried the way of research and science, on the development of new and innovative technology but it never reached a passion higher than a mere curiosity. 

So I changed to computer science and fell madly in love with programming, like very few other things in my life. I wasn't a good student and failed many of my classes, but I remember what I learned and apply it more often than I'd expected back then. As soon as I learned how to make things with a certain level of confidence, I started selling it as a service.
