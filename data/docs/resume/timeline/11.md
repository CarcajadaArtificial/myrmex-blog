This is a company that sells SaaS, I was hired by the Microsoft Sharepoint team. They taught me everything about Sharepoint from the ground up because I knew nothing back then. My role in the team is to use SCSS, TypeScript, and HTML to build the front-end of new "WebParts" (high-level Sharepoint react components) while another member of the team manages Sharepoint's API in order to manage stored data.
