Hello ``( ´ ω ` )ノﾞ`` my name is Oscar Alfonso Guerrero, I go by [CarcajadaArtificial]() on GitHub; let me welcome you to my site and personally thank you for being interested in reading. The purpose of this site is to store and showcase many of the things that I do and think.

I'm an enthusiast in many topics, and **web development** has been the interest I chose to make a living out of. Next to it, is a **UI/UX design** passion in my early years and most recently an interest in **lean back-end services**. As a developer hobbyist, I'm forced to do mostly everything myself, from designing to database mounting, passing through project management, testing, security, CI/CD, etc. Obviously, I'm not a master in all of these, but I definitely know my way with them enough to build web tools and applications. My other hobbies include movies, music, photography, gardening, Super Smash Bros Melee, and game development.
